## 2. Understanding the Role of the App Embed

The app embed ensures that your chatbot loads automatically on all pages of your store. Once activated, it will be available to assist customers with:

- Answering product-related questions.
- Guiding users through order tracking and support.
- Recommending products based on store data.
