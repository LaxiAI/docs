# Securing and Managing Your AI Chatbot  

The **Model Controls** section allows you to define where your chatbot can be used and provides an option to delete it if a full reset is required. By setting domain restrictions, you ensure that your chatbot is only accessible on authorized websites, and if necessary, you can permanently remove it to start fresh.

To access these settings, go to **Laxi.ai Dashboard → Model Controls**.

## 1. Restricting Chatbot Access  

To prevent unauthorized usage, you can assign a **specific domain** where the chatbot is allowed to load. This ensures that even if someone has the chatbot’s ID, it cannot function outside of the permitted website.

### Adding a Domain  
1. Enter the **domain URL** where your chatbot should be active.  
2. Click **Save Domains** to enforce this restriction.  
3. The chatbot will now only operate on the specified website.

<Info>
If no domain is set, the chatbot may be accessible outside your intended platform. Adding a domain ensures **full control over where your chatbot is used**.

## 2. Deleting Your Chatbot  

If you need to completely reset your chatbot and start fresh, you can **delete the chatbot instance**. This removes all configurations and training data associated with the bot.

### **How to Delete Your Chatbot**  
1. Open the **Model Controls** section.  
2. Click **Delete Chatbot** at the bottom of the page.  
3. Confirm your action in the prompt.

<Note>
**Warning:** This action is **permanent** and **cannot be undone**. Once deleted, all chatbot data will be erased, and you will need to create a new bot from scratch.
</Note>

## Final Thoughts  

Model controls help you **secure and manage** your AI chatbot effectively. By restricting its usage to a specific domain, you ensure that it remains exclusive to your platform. If needed, the chatbot can also be deleted and rebuilt for a fresh start.
