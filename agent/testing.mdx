# Simulating & Refining Chatbot Responses  

Before launching your AI agent, it's essential to test how it interacts with users. The **Testing & Debugging** section lets you experiment with different queries, evaluate chatbot accuracy, and make improvements to ensure seamless customer interactions.

## Accessing the Testing & Debugging Section  

To begin, navigate to the **Laxi.ai Dashboard → Playground**. This section allows you to test and refine your AI agent before going live.

Once inside the testing environment, you’ll see a **chat interface** where you can interact with your AI agent in real-time.

## Testing Suggested Messages  

Suggested messages allow customers to click on **predefined queries** instead of typing. Testing these ensures that your AI delivers relevant and accurate responses.

### Testing Product Queries  

A customer might ask about popular products. Selecting the **"Our most liked product"** option should display the top-rated items from your store.

### Finding the Right Gift  

Customers often look for gift recommendations. Clicking **"Help me find a gift"** should generate product suggestions tailored to gifting.

### Checking Return Policy  

If a user asks about returns by selecting **"Return policy"**, the chatbot should pull accurate details from your stored knowledge base.

### Understanding Privacy Policies  

Users concerned about data security may ask about privacy policies. Clicking **"Privacy policy"** should retrieve verified information from your business policies.

## Testing Conversational Flow  

A good chatbot can handle multi-step conversations while maintaining context. You can test this by asking follow-up questions about a product.

### Example: Snowboard Inquiry  

1. **User:** What snowboard options do I have?  
   - **AI:** *Displays a list of available snowboards.*  

   <img src="/images/agent-config/snowboard-options.png" alt="AI displays snowboard options" style={{ marginTop: '1rem', maxWidth: '100%' }} />

2. **User:** Which is the best one?  
   - **AI:** *Recommends the highest-rated snowboard.*  

   <img src="/images/agent-config/best-snowboard.png" alt="AI recommends top snowboard" style={{ marginTop: '1rem', maxWidth: '100%' }} />

3. **User:** Can you give more details on this?  
   - **AI:** *Provides specifications, features, and pricing.*  

   <img src="/images/agent-config/more-details-snowboard.png" alt="AI shows product details" style={{ marginTop: '1rem', maxWidth: '100%' }} />

4. **User:** Is it strong and reliable?  
   - **AI:** *Confirms the durability of the snowboard.*
