# Managing Your AI's Data Sources  

Your AI agent relies on accurate and up-to-date information to assist customers effectively. The **Data Sources** section allows you to connect ecommerce platforms, upload files, and manage FAQs to enhance your chatbot’s knowledge.  

To get started, navigate to **Laxi.ai Dashboard → Data Sources**. This is where you can view and manage all connected data.

## Connecting Your Ecommerce Store  

Laxi.ai supports multiple ways to import products. Depending on your platform, you can either sync your store automatically or connect manually.

### **For Shopify Users**  
If you are using Shopify, your product catalog is **automatically connected** and stays synced with Laxi.ai. There’s no need for manual integration.  

- Shopify products **sync automatically** to your AI agent.  
- The Shopify integration **cannot be removed**, but you can **resync data anytime**.  

### **Resyncing Shopify Data**  
If you have recently updated your Shopify store, click the **Resync** button to pull the latest product updates into Laxi.ai.
