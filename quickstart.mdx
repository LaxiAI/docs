## 5. Deploying Your Chatbot

Once everything is set up, the final step is to **deploy your chatbot** by embedding it into your website. Navigate to **Laxi.ai Dashboard â†’ Share & Deploy** to:

- Copy the embed code for your chatbot.
- Paste it into your website's HTML before the `</body>` tag.

Insert the provided script into your website's HTML to activate the chatbot.
