# Adding Laxi.ai to Your Website with Manual Embed  

Laxi.ai can be integrated into any website using a simple embed script. This flexible solution enables chatbot functionality across all platforms, including custom websites, static pages, and various ecommerce platforms.

## 1. Accessing the Embed Code  

To get started, navigate to the **Laxi.ai Dashboard â†’ Share & Deploy** section. This is where you'll find the embed script needed for manual integration.

## 2. Copying the Embed Script  

Inside the Share & Deploy tab, you'll see a JavaScript snippet. This is your unique chatbot embed code.

Click **Copy** to easily copy the script for integration.

## 3. Adding the Code to Your Website  

Once you have the embed code, you need to place it in your website's HTML.

1. Open your website's HTML file or CMS editor.  
2. Locate the `</body>` tag at the bottom of the page.  
3. Paste the Laxi.ai embed script right before the closing `</body>` tag.  
4. Save and publish your changes.

<Tip>
For the best performance, add the script just before the closing `</body>` tag. This ensures the chatbot loads efficiently without slowing down the rest of your page.
</Tip>

## 4. Verifying the Integration  

After embedding the script, visit your website and refresh the page. The chatbot should now appear and be ready to assist visitors. If you don't see it:

- Double-check that the script was added correctly.  
- Clear your browser cache and refresh the page.  
- Ensure there are no conflicting scripts blocking external resources.
