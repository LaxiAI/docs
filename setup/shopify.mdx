# Setting Up Laxi.ai for Shopify  

Laxi.ai integrates with Shopify, allowing you to automate customer interactions, answer queries, and provide product recommendations seamlessly. This guide will take you through the setup process, from installation to testing your chatbot.

Before you begin, make sure you have an **active Shopify store** and the necessary **admin permissions** to install apps.

## 1. Installing Laxi.ai from the Shopify App Store  

The first step is to install the Laxi.ai app from Shopify’s **App Store**.

1. Open the **[Laxi.ai App Store Page](https://apps.shopify.com/laxi-ai)**.  
2. Click **Add app**, then follow the prompts to install it on your store.  
3. Once the installation is complete, you’ll find **Laxi.ai** listed under the **Apps** section in your Shopify admin panel.

## 2. Accepting Required Permissions  

During installation, Shopify will request permissions that allow Laxi.ai to access product details, orders, and customer inquiries. These permissions are essential for the chatbot to function properly.

## 3. Logging into Laxi.ai  

Once the app is installed, you’ll need to log in to the **Laxi.ai Dashboard** to start configuring your chatbot.
